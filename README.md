# Gorgia-AI-Chat-System
 Below is a basic Python code that demonstrates how to configure a knowledge base for an AI chat system like Gorgias using Python. This setup will automate responses and help in building an efficient AI-based customer service system.
Python Code Example for Configuring Gorgias AI Chat System

This script simulates the process of training and configuring an AI chatbot using Gorgias and integrating it with a knowledge base (using a simple dictionary for demonstration). You can extend this by integrating with the Gorgias API or a more sophisticated knowledge base.

import requests
import json

# Gorgias API Configuration
API_KEY = 'your_gorgias_api_key'
GORGIAS_API_URL = 'https://yourdomain.gorgias.com/api/v1'

# Function to fetch current knowledge base data from Gorgias
def get_knowledge_base():
    url = f"{GORGIAS_API_URL}/knowledge_base"
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'}
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Error fetching knowledge base: {response.status_code}")
        return None

# Function to create or update knowledge base articles in Gorgias
def create_or_update_article(title, content):
    url = f"{GORGIAS_API_URL}/knowledge_base/articles"
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'}
    
    payload = {
        'title': title,
        'content': content,
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Article '{title}' created/updated successfully.")
    else:
        print(f"Error creating/updating article: {response.status_code}")

# Function to train the AI system based on the knowledge base (example: FAQs)
def train_ai_with_knowledge_base():
    knowledge_base = get_knowledge_base()
    if knowledge_base:
        for article in knowledge_base['data']:
            title = article['title']
            content = article['content']
            # Here, you can refine AI training logic based on the content
            print(f"Training AI with article: {title}")
            # Simulate training AI with knowledge base content
            create_or_update_article(title, content)

# Sample function to handle AI responses based on input
def ai_response(user_input):
    responses = {
        'hello': 'Hello! How can I assist you today?',
        'order status': 'Let me check the status of your order.',
        'refund policy': 'You can request a refund within 30 days of purchase.',
    }
    
    # Simple AI based response (expand this logic as needed)
    return responses.get(user_input.lower(), "Sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you please rephrase?")

# Function to simulate an interaction with the chatbot
def interact_with_user():
    while True:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
            break
        
        # Get AI response based on the user input
        response = ai_response(user_input)
        print(f"AI: {response}")

# Main function to train AI and run chatbot
def main():
    print("Training AI with knowledge base...")
    train_ai_with_knowledge_base()
    
    print("Chatbot ready. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.")
    interact_with_user()

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Key Concepts in This Code:

    Gorgias API Integration:
        The get_knowledge_base function fetches existing knowledge base articles from the Gorgias API.
        The create_or_update_article function allows you to add new articles or update existing ones in the knowledge base.

    Training the AI:
        In the train_ai_with_knowledge_base function, the AI is trained using knowledge base articles. While the example is simplified (using a static dictionary for responses), in practice, you would feed these articles into an AI model like GPT for better, dynamic responses.

    Handling User Queries:
        The ai_response function uses a predefined dictionary to simulate basic AI responses. You can replace this with an actual AI model for more sophisticated handling.

    Interactivity:
        The interact_with_user function simulates a conversation with the user. Itâ€™s where the chatbot waits for user input and responds accordingly.

Steps to Expand This:

    Integrating with Advanced AI:
        Instead of simple responses, you could integrate a GPT-based model (e.g., OpenAI) or DialogFlow to generate real-time, sophisticated answers.

    Integrating Gorgias Workflows:
        Extend this script to trigger workflows within Gorgias after a conversation, such as creating tickets or sending automated emails.

    UI Interface:
        Build a front-end chat interface on your website or app using frameworks like React or Vue.js, and use this backend Python service to power the chatbot.

Conclusion:

The provided Python code demonstrates how to set up a basic Gorgias AI integration for automating customer support. The next step involves refining the AI responses, training with a robust knowledge base, and adding real-time capabilities that can assist with complex queries. This solution should improve customer service efficiency and accuracy.
